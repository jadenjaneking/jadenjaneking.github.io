<h1 style="text-align:left">Some Little Bug</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:left">By John Leroy Atwell</h2>
<p style="text-align:left">In these days of indigestion<br/>
It is oftentimes a question<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">As to what to eat and what to leave alone;<br/>
For each microbe and bacillus<br/>
Has a different way to kill us,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">And in time they always claim us for their own.<br/>
There are germs of every kind<br/>
In any food that you can find<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">In the market or upon the bill of fare.<br/>
Drinking water's just as risky<br/>
As the so-called deadly whiskey,<br/>
	And it's often a mistake to breathe the air.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">Some little bug is going to find you someday,<br/>
Some little bug will creep behind you someday,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">Then he'll send for his bug friends<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">And all your earthly trouble ends;<br/>
Some little bug is going to find you some day.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">The inviting green cucumber<br/>
Gets most everybody's number,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">While the green corn has a system of its own;<br/>
Though a radish seems nutritious<br/>
Its behaviour is quite vicious,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">And a doctor will be coming to your home.<br/>
Eating lobster cooked or plain<br/>
Is only flirting with ptomaine,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">While an oyster sometimes has a lot to say,<br/>
But the clams we cat in chowder<br/>
Make the angels chant the louder,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">For they know that we'll be with them right away.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">Take a slice of nice fried onion<br/>
And you're fit for Dr. Munyon,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">Apple dumplings kill you quicker than a train.<br/>
Chew a cheesy midnight "rabbit"<br/>
And a grave you'll soon inhabit<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">Ah, to eat at all is such a foolish game.<br/>
Eating huckleberry pie<br/>
Is a pleasing way to die,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">While sauerkraut brings on softening of the brain.<br/>
When you eat banana fritters<br/>
Every undertaker titters,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">And the casket makers nearly go insane.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">Some little bug is going to find you some day,<br/>
Some little bug will creep behind you some day,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">With a nervous little quiver<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">He'll give cirrhosis of the liver;<br/>
Some little bug is going to find you some day.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">When cold storage vaults I visit<br/>
I can only say what is it<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">Makes poor mortals fill their systems with such stuff?<br/>
Now, for breakfast, prunes are dandy<br/>
If a stomach pump is handy<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">And your doctor can be found quite soon enough.<br/>
Eat a plate of fine pigs' knuckles<br/>
And the headstone cutter chuckles,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">While the grave digger makes a note upon his cuff.<br/>
Eat that lovely red bologna<br/>
And you'll wear a wooden kimona,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">As your relatives start scrappin 'bout your stuff.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">Some little bug is going to find you some day,<br/>
Some little bug will creep behind you some day,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">Eating juicy sliced pineapple<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">Makes the sexton dust the chapel;<br/>
Some little bug is going to find you some day.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">All those crazy foods they mix<br/>
Will float us 'cross the River Styx,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">Or they'll start us climbing up the milky way.<br/>
And the meals we eat in courses<br/>
Mean a hearse and two black horses<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">So before a meal some people always pray.<br/>
Luscious grapes breed 'pendicitis,<br/>
And the juice leads to gastritis,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">So there's only death to greet us either way;<br/>
And fried liver's nice, but, mind you,<br/>
Friends will soon ride slow behind you<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">And the papers then will have nice things to say.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">Some little bug is going to find you some day,<br/>
Some little bug will creep behind you some day,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">Eat some sauce, they call it chili,<br/>
<span style="margin-left:2em">On your breast they'll place a lily;<br/>
Some little bug is going to find you some day.</p>
